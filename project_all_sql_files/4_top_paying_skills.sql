Here's a breakdown of Insights:
- Big Data & ML Tools Pay the Most: Skills like PySpark, Databricks, Scikit-learn, and DataRobot are linked to salaries above $150K, reflecting demand for analysts with machine learning and data engineering expertise.
- Cloud & DevOps Knowledge Boosts Value: Tools such as GCP, Kubernetes, Airflow, and GitLab show that analysts who can work with automated pipelines and scalable cloud environments are highly paid.
- Coding Versatility Matters: High salaries for Pandas, Numpy, PostgreSQL, and even Swift/Golang suggest that programming fluency beyond basic Python is a strong differentiator in analytics roles.

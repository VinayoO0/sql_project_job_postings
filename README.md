## The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at iinvestigatiing specifiic aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top paying Data Analyst jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high payinng opportunities in the field. 
```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'India' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10

```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $190,000 to $222,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

- **Diverse Employees:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are amoung those offering high salaries, showing a broad intrest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specialization within data analytics.

### 2. Top-paying Data Analyst job_skills
To identify the Top-paying Data Analyst job skills, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and job skills, 

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'India' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC;

```
Here's the breakdown of the top-paying data analyst job skills in 2023:
- SQL, Python, and Tableau are the most frequently demanded skills.

- AWS and Power BI are associated with the highest average salaries.

- Pandas and Excel, while common, are also linked to high-paying 
  roles‚Äîlikely due to their use in advanced analytics and business 
  reporting.

- Strong data stack skills (e.g., SQL, Snowflake, Python, Pandas) and 
  data visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI) dominate the landscape.

### 3. Top-Demanded skills for Data Analyst jobs
To identify the top-demanded skills for Data Analyst jobs, I filtered data analyst positions by job skills, and ranked them by skills based on skill_count

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_skill_count
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'India'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_skill_count DESC
LIMIT 5

```
Here's the breakdown of the top-demanded skills for Data Analyst jobs in India:
